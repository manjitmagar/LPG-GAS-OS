The LPG Gas Ordering System is a robust backend solution designed to streamline the process of ordering liquefied petroleum gas online. I developed this system to handle critical functions such as user authentication, inventory management, and real-time order processing. One of the key features of the system is its seamless integration with secure payment gateways, allowing customers to place and pay for orders with confidence. Additionally, I implemented real-time order tracking to provide users with live updates on their order status, enhancing transparency and user experience. This project showcases my proficiency in backend development and my ability to build scalable, secure systems that meet real-world commercial needs.
